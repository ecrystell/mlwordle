mlwordle.vercel.app

MLWordle is an adaptation of Wordle in NYTimes and Loldle (Wordle as League of Legends characters)
This project allows users to guess Mobile Legends heroes based on their characteristics, such as gender, lane played and role.

It is intended to be a web application that works like Loldle and is a project for personal use and not intended for high traffic.
